How to Use the Weather App:
To use the weather app, simply open the HTML file in a web browser using a live server (such as the Live Server extension in VS Code).
Once opened, enter a city or state name in the input field and click the search icon on the left. 
The app will fetch and display the current weather conditions for that location, including the temperature in Celsius, a weather description (like "Rainy," "Cloudy," or "Haze"), and an icon representing the weather.
